        <h5 class="card-title">The Problem + Our Solution</h5>
        <p class="card-text"> For the past 48 years, the percentage of people casting their votes from the voting-eligible population (VEP) and voting-age population (VAP) has been around only 50-60%. So, why don't people vote? According to a study held by the Pew Research Center, half of the surveyed population reported that they did not learn about the election, thinking that the wouldn't matter anyway. Many Americans don't realize the impact of their vote. By providing proper preparation and guidance, VOICE hopes to educate those who haven't tried to vote. </p>
